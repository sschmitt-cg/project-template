# /test-companion

Guide the user through pending manual tests and open questions from prior builds.
Reads `.build/TEST_TRACKER.md` and `.build/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, walks through each
item interactively, and updates both files in real time after each response.

---

## Pre-step — Sweep externally-checked items

A separate web-based test helper (in the user's master-control-room project) marks
items in `.build/TEST_TRACKER.md` by toggling `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in the Pending
section, but it does not move them to Completed. Before any other work in this
command, reconcile that state.

If `.build/TEST_TRACKER.md` exists:

1. Scan the Pending section for entries beginning with `- [x] `.
2. For each match, collect the checkbox line **and all immediately-following
   indented continuation lines** (the `**Steps:**`, `**Expected:**`, `**Added:**`
   lines that belong to the same entry). The block ends at the next non-indented
   line, the next checkbox at the same level, or end of section.
3. Remove the entire block from Pending.
4. Append a single line to the Completed section in the form:
   `[x] [title] — passed [today's date]`
   (Use the test title from the checkbox line. Today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD`.)
5. If removing the block leaves an `### [Area]` heading with no remaining
   checkbox entries, leave the heading in place — it may be repopulated by a
   later build. The "Consolidate pending items" pre-step below handles structural
   cleanup.
6. Write the updated file to disk before proceeding.

This sweep also applies whenever `/auto-build` or `/next-step` count pending
tests during pre-flight; those commands reference this procedure.

---

## Pre-step 2 — Consolidate pending items

Run this once, after the sweep and before loading items, so the session works from a
de-duplicated, well-ordered list. `/auto-build` appends new tests and questions
without sorting; consolidation happens here, just-in-time. Skip it if the Pending
section of TEST_TRACKER.md and the Unresolved section of OPEN_QUESTIONS.md each have
fewer than 2 entries — there is nothing to consolidate.

Rewrite both files in place. For a very large backlog this may be delegated to a
sub-agent; for the common small case, do it inline.

**For OPEN_QUESTIONS.md (Unresolved section only):**
- Merge duplicate or near-duplicate questions into a single entry, combining
  defaults and revisit conditions
- Remove any question already answered in the Resolved section
- Do not touch the Resolved section

**For TEST_TRACKER.md (Pending section only):**
- Merge duplicate or overlapping tests into a single entry
- Group remaining tests by app location/screen/user flow (e.g., "Login",
  "Dashboard", "Settings"). Create a `### [Area]` heading for each group.
- Within each group, order tests to minimize back-and-forth navigation — complete
  everything testable in one location before moving to another
- Across groups, order groups by natural user flow sequence (onboarding before
  features, setup before use, happy path before edge cases)
- Honor explicit dependency notes — if a test says "requires X first," preserve
  that ordering even if it crosses group boundaries
- Do not touch the Completed section

---

## Step 1 — Load pending items

Check whether actionable content exists:
- Run `ls .build/TEST_TRACKER.md 2>/dev/null || echo absent` — if present, read the
  Pending section and count items
- Run `ls .build/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md 2>/dev/null || echo absent` — if present, read the
  Unresolved section and count items

If neither file exists or both sections are empty: report "Nothing pending — all
clear." and stop.

---

## Step 2 — Report scope and ask for order

Present a summary of what's pending (omit any line that has zero items):
- "X pending tests across Y groups"
- "Z unresolved questions"

If only one type of content exists, skip the order question and proceed directly
to the relevant step (Step 3 for tests, Step 4 for questions).

If both exist, ask: "Start with **tests**, **questions**, or **both interleaved**?"
(Interleaved means: tests and questions are interspersed throughout the session.
Where a question is clearly related to a test area by topic, present it after that
area's tests. Otherwise, distribute questions evenly across the session. This is
best-effort — questions are not area-tagged.)

---

## Step 3 — Manual testing session

Work through the Pending section of TEST_TRACKER.md one test at a time, in the
order they appear (the Consolidate pending items pre-step has already optimized
this order — do not re-sort).

For each test:

1. Show the area heading and test title
2. Show the numbered steps and expected result
3. Ask: **Pass / Fail / Skip**

**Pass:**
- Remove the entry from the Pending section
- Append it to the Completed section as `[x] [title] — passed [today's date]`
- Write the update to TEST_TRACKER.md immediately
- Proceed to the next test

**Fail:**
- Ask the user to briefly describe what actually happened
- Record the failure note on the entry
- Offer three options (pick one):
  1. Log as a GitHub issue (`gh issue create`)
  2. Add to `BACKLOG.md` as a bug — append under a `## Bugs` section (create it
     at the top of the file, before Phase sections, if it doesn't exist)
  3. Just note the failure and continue
- Take the chosen action, then write the update to TEST_TRACKER.md
- Leave the entry in Pending, changing `[ ]` to `[!]` (known failure awaiting fix)
- Proceed to the next test

**Skip:**
- Ask for a brief reason (e.g., "can't test locally", "waiting on data", "not yet built")
- Append `— skipped [today's date]: [reason]` to the entry
- Leave the entry in Pending
- Write the update to TEST_TRACKER.md immediately
- Proceed to the next test

---

## Step 4 — Open questions session

Work through the Unresolved section of OPEN_QUESTIONS.md one question at a time.

For each question:

1. Show the question, current default used, revisit condition, and which build added it
2. Ask for a response — the user may **answer**, **defer**, or **dismiss**

**Answered:**
- Move the entry from Unresolved to the Resolved section with:
  - The answer
  - `Resolved: [today's date]`
- If the answer differs from the default used, add: `Note: default was [X] —
  code may need updating.` Then ask the user: "Should I add a BACKLOG.md item to
  implement this correction?" If yes, append it as a bug/task item.
- Write the update to OPEN_QUESTIONS.md immediately

**Deferred:**
- Leave the entry in Unresolved
- Append `Last reviewed: [today's date]` to the entry
- Write the update to OPEN_QUESTIONS.md immediately

**Dismissed:**
- Remove the entry from Unresolved entirely
- Write the update to OPEN_QUESTIONS.md immediately

---

## Step 5 — Session summary

When all items have been addressed (or the user stops early):

Report:
- **Tests:** X passed, Y failed (with issue/backlog links if created), Z skipped
- **Questions:** X answered, Y deferred, Z dismissed
- If any items remain pending: "Run `/test-companion` again to continue."
- If any answered question flagged a code update: list those questions and what
  to revisit

---

## Notes

- Write every update immediately after the user responds — do not batch changes.
  If the session is interrupted, files reflect the state up to the last completed item.
- The Completed section of TEST_TRACKER.md and the Resolved section of
  OPEN_QUESTIONS.md are append-only — never remove or modify entries there.
- Do not re-sort or regroup tests during a session. Consolidation happens once at
  the start of this command (the "Consolidate pending items" pre-step), not
  mid-session.
- TEST_TRACKER.md checkbox conventions: `[ ]` pending, `[x]` passed, `[!]` failed
  (known failure awaiting a fix — still in Pending until resolved).
